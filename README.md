Just tap the city you want to go to, and click the "Enter" key to drive the whole machine !


Some and information to take into account before diving in ! :

1. Currently the display only has the space for 6-letter cities (or words) due to resolution limitations on the free Touch Designer license
2. For cities (or words) that are less than 6 letters long, or that feature a space within the 6 letter placeholder, you need to place a slash ( "/" ) instead of the space.
3. For cities (or words) featuring the character "-" , you need to place an underscore "_"
