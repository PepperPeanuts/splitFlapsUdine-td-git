Some and information to take into account before diving in ! :

1. Currently the display only has the space for 6-letter cities (or words) due to resolution limitations on the free Touch Designer license
2. For cities (or words) that are less than 6 letters long, or that feature a space within the 6 letter placeholder, you need to place a slash ( "/" ) instead of the space.
3. For cities (or words) featuring the character "-" , you need to place an underscore "_"
4. "Reset Button" in the UI is used to clear the system and put all flaps on initial mode "AAAAAA"
5. If desired, you may display only the frontal flaps by using the button in the UI
